# Mapping_Earthquakes
* Using the Leaflet.js API, I populated a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. 
* I used JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features and interactivity to the maps. Each of the earthquakes were shown on a map with circle and color which changed with the magnitude -- darker and larger colors signifying more severe earthquakes. 
* I used Data-Driven Documents library to make this map, and the leaflet control pluggins allowed for multiple map layers to be added onto the geographical maps. 
* The index.html file with the maps was rendered on a local server.
* The final map looked as below:
