# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using the Leaflet.js API, I populated a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. I used JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features and interactivity to the maps. Each of the earthquakes were shown on a map with circle and color which changed with the magnitude -- darker and larger colors signifying more severe earthquakes. The Data-Driven Documents library was used to make this map, and the leaflet control pluggins allowed for multiple map layers to be added onto the geographical maps. The index.html file with the maps were rendered on a local server.
The final map looked as below:
